# clean-coding-typescript
This repo talks about the clean coding principles mentioned in "Clean Coding by Robert C Martin" all the examples in this repository are in typescript.

# What is Clean Code?
> Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designerâ€™s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward linesof control. **- Grady Booch**

> Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone **- Dave Thomas**

Clean code is a well structured, simple to understand, easy to maintain and thoroughly tested code. It should make sense for others in the team at a first glance. 

I really like one quote by the author on maintaining the application by infering the boy scout rule. ***Leave the campgrounds cleaner than you found it***. This perfectly fits in maintaining the application. Always make sure to make the existing code cleaner than before.

Below are some principles mentioned in the book.
## 1. Meaningful Names
